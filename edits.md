### 2024-12-19 - Fixed Achievement Display Issue (Private Game Statistics)

**Problem:**
- Achievements were showing as "0/XX" even when users had achievements (e.g., user reported 43/55 achievements but site showed 0/55)
- Steam API was returning 403 "Profile is not public" errors for achievement data despite having a public profile
- Root cause: Steam has separate privacy settings for profile visibility vs game statistics/achievements

**Investigation:**
- User's profile visibility showed as public (level 3) but achievement requests failed with 403 errors
- Steam allows public profiles but private game details/statistics
- Frontend was displaying misleading "0/XX" instead of indicating data is private

**Solution:**
- Enhanced achievements API to properly detect when game statistics are private
- Added `isPrivateProfile` flag at both game and response levels
- Frontend now shows "Private" or "*Profile privacy restricts achievement data" instead of "0/XX"
- Added detection for specific error messages: "Profile is not public", "Requested app has no stats", and 403 status codes

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `pages/api/achievements.ts`:
  - Added `isGameStatsPrivate` detection logic
  - Set `isPrivateProfile: true` for games with private statistics
  - Added main response flag when majority of games have private stats
  - Enhanced error handling for 403 responses
- Frontend (`components/GameAnalytics.tsx`) already had proper handling for private profiles

**User Experience:**
- Users with private game statistics now see accurate "Private" messaging
- No more confusing "0/XX achievements" displays
- Clear indication that privacy settings are restricting data access
- Still shows total achievements available for games (from public schema data)

#### Enhanced Display for Games Without Achievements
- **Problem**: Games that don't have achievements were showing "0/0" or being treated as private, which was confusing
- **Solution**: Added proper handling for games that genuinely don't support achievements
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `components/GameAnalytics.tsx` to display "No achievements" instead of "0/0" for games with no achievements
  - Added logic to hide progress bars for games with no achievements
  - Enhanced `calculateOverallStats` to only consider games with achievements for achievement statistics
  - Updated overall stats display to show "(X/Y games)" to indicate how many games have achievements
  - Added clear messaging: "This game does not support achievements" for games without achievement systems
- **Impact**: Clear distinction between games with no achievements, games with private data, and games with unlocked achievements

#### Fixed Logic Bug for Games Without Achievements
- **Problem**: Games like The Elder Scrolls® Online were showing "Private" instead of "No achievements" due to incorrect error handling logic
- **Root Cause**: API was incorrectly treating "Requested app has no stats" as a privacy error when it actually means the game has no achievements
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated error detection logic to only set `isGameStatsPrivate = true` for actual privacy errors ("Profile is not public" or 403 status)
  - Removed "Requested app has no stats" from privacy error detection
  - Ensured games with no achievements (`hasAchievements = false`) are never marked as private (`isPrivateProfile = false`)
- **Impact**: Games without Steam achievements now correctly show "No achievements" instead of "Private"

#### Updated UI to Show "N/A" for Games Without Achievements
- **Problem**: Even after fixing the logic bug, games without achievements were still showing "0/0" which was confusing
- **Solution**: Updated the frontend display to show "N/A" instead of "0/0" for clearer user experience

- Removed purchase type analysis from GameAnalytics (free/sale/full price indicators)
- Cleaned up invalid financial calculations based on current Steam prices instead of historical purchase data

**Changes:**
- **pages/index.tsx**: Removed SmartShopperScore component import and usage
- **components/SmartShopperScore.tsx**: Deleted entire file
- **components/GameAnalytics.tsx**: Removed invalid functions and purchase type card:
  - Removed `getPurchaseType()` function
  - Removed `getDominantPurchaseType()` function
  - Removed `calculatePriceInfo()` function
  - Removed `calculateSmartShopperScore()` function
  - Removed purchase type card from stats grid
  - Cleaned up unused imports (Gift, Tag, Wallet, HelpCircle, etc.)
  - Kept only achievements and metacritic cards in analytics

**Reason for Removal:**
Steam Web API limitations prevent access to:
- Actual purchase prices paid by users
- Historical purchase dates
- Transaction history
- Bundle purchase information

The system was incorrectly using current Steam store prices and sale status to estimate historical purchase behavior, which is fundamentally flawed and misleading to users.

**User Experience:**
- More honest and accurate analytics
- Focus on valid data (achievements, metacritic scores, game details)
- Removed confusing and incorrect financial estimates
- Cleaner, more focused game analytics interface

# Project Changes Log

## Game Count Discrepancy Fix - December 2024

### Issue
Fixed misleading total game count that was showing all games from Steam API (including unplayed games) instead of the actual games being displayed.

### Changes Made
- **Steam API endpoint** (`pages/api/steam.ts`):
  - Changed `totalGames` calculation from `gamesData.response.game_count` to `playedGames.length`

  - Fixes discrepancy where total showed 191 but actual games array only had 164 games

### Result
- Total game count now accurately reflects the games being displayed
- "Visible Games" count will correctly show played games vs actual total
- Eliminates confusion between Steam's total game count and displayed game count

## 2024-12-21 - Fixed Authentication Callback Function Scope Error

**Bug Fix:**
- Fixed "fetchSteamData is not a function" runtime error in authentication callback handling
- Resolved JavaScript function expression hoisting issue that prevented authentication flows from working

**Problem:**
- The `fetchSteamData` function was defined after the `useEffect` that tried to call it
- JavaScript function expressions (const fetchSteamData = async ...) are not hoisted like function declarations
- This caused a runtime error when OAuth authentication callbacks tried to fetch Steam data

**Changes:**
- **pages/index.tsx**: Restructured function definition order:
  - Moved `fetchSteamData` function definition before the authentication callback `useEffect`
  - Moved `fetchFriendsData`, `fetchRankingsData`, and all other handler functions to proper positions
  - Placed authentication callback `useEffect` after all function definitions
  - Maintained hydration check in correct position before JSX return

**Code Structure (Fixed):**
1. All function definitions (fetchSteamData, fetchFriendsData, handlers, etc.)
2. Authentication callback useEffect (can now access functions)
3. Hydration check and early return
4. Main JSX return

**User Experience:**
- Steam OAuth authentication now works correctly without runtime errors
- QR code authentication flows function properly
- Authentication callbacks successfully fetch and display Steam data
- No more "function is not defined" errors during authentication

The authentication system is now fully functional with proper JavaScript function scoping and execution order.

## 2024-12-21 - Removed QR Code Authentication System

**Files Removed:**
- `pages/api/auth/qr/generate.ts` - QR code generation API endpoint
- `pages/api/auth/qr/poll.ts` - QR code polling API endpoint  
- `pages/api/auth/qr/authenticate.ts` - QR code authentication API endpoint
- `pages/auth/qr/[sessionId].tsx` - QR code authentication page
- `components/QRCodeAuth.tsx` - QR code authentication component

**Files Modified:**
- `components/AuthenticationModal.tsx`: Removed QR code tab system and component usage:
  - Removed `QRCodeAuth` import
  - Removed `activeTab` state management
  - Removed tab navigation UI
  - Simplified to show only Steam OAuth login option
  - Removed AnimatePresence wrapper around authentication methods

- `package.json`: Removed QR code related dependencies:
  - Removed `qrcode` package (QR code generation library)
  - Removed `@types/qrcode` package (TypeScript types)
  - Kept `uuid` and `@types/uuid` as they're still used for OAuth session management

**Authentication Methods (After Removal):**
1. **Manual Steam ID/URL Input** (existing functionality)
2. **Steam OAuth Authentication** (functional - redirects to Steam's official login)

**User Experience:**
- Cleaner, more focused authentication interface
- No misleading QR code option that doesn't actually work with Steam mobile app
- Single, reliable authentication method through Steam's official OAuth system
- Removed confusion about QR code functionality

**Technical Impact:**

## 2024-12-28 - Fixed Steam Authentication Domain Redirect Issue

**Problem Fixed:**
- Steam authentication was hardcoded to redirect to localhost instead of using the current domain
- When deployed to production (e.g., `https://howmuchtime-wccw.vercel.app/`), Steam OAuth would redirect back to `http://localhost:3000`
- This caused authentication failures in production environments

**Solution Implemented:**
- Made the Steam authentication redirect URL dynamic based on the current request domain
- Automatically detects the protocol (http/https) and host from request headers
- Works seamlessly across all environments (localhost, staging, production, custom domains)

**Technical Changes:**
- **Dynamic URL Construction**: Replaced hardcoded `process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'` with dynamic URL detection
- **Protocol Detection**: Uses `x-forwarded-proto` header or connection encryption to determine http/https
- **Host Detection**: Uses `x-forwarded-host` or `host` header to get the current domain
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any domain without code changes

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before (hardcoded):
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'

// After (dynamic):
const protocol = req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'] || (req.connection as any)?.encrypted ? 'https' : 'http'
const host = req.headers['x-forwarded-host'] || req.headers.host
const baseUrl = `${protocol}://${host}`
```

**Files Modified:**
- `pages/api/auth/steam/login.ts`: Updated to use dynamic URL construction

**Benefits:**
- **Environment Agnostic**: Works in development, staging, and production without configuration
- **Domain Flexible**: Supports any domain name without code changes
- **Automatic Detection**: No need to manually update URLs when changing domains
- **Reliable Authentication**: Steam OAuth now works correctly in all environments

**User Experience:**
- **Seamless Login**: Steam authentication now works properly on the live site
- **No Redirects to Localhost**: Users stay on the correct domain throughout the auth flow
- **Consistent Experience**: Same authentication flow works across all environments

This fix ensures that Steam authentication works correctly regardless of the domain being used, eliminating the need for manual URL updates when deploying to different environments.
